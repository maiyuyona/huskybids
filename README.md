## About HuskyBids!
HuskyBids is a webapp dedicated to UW students to increase engagement with UW sports and allow students to keep up with their favourite UW sport teams. We hope to encourage all UW students to engage more with UW sports whether by keeping up with their current teams or discover new sports to follow. To make this experience more interactive, students can join groups ("packs") to bet in-game currency ("biscuits") on the outcomes of UW games, and earn rewards based on their predictions!
